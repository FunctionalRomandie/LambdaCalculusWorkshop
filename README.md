## Workshop on Lambda Calculus
On the 16 July 2015, we run a worshop on the Lambda Calculus at FunctionalRomandie (http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Romandie/events/220005812/).

We were able to walk thru the whole calculus even if were not able to implemente it entierely, I think we did a pretty good job and understanding the core expressions!

The slides of the introduction are available here:

You'll find in this repository, different calculus implementations done during the workshop.

It's nice to see that different languages and technices were used!

*Note:* you'll find in my implementation 4 different calculus that represent the step we *should* have followed yesterday (sorry for having followed the wrong path at some point!), you can find as well the implementation of a relatively complete calculus in the last one.

Thanks again for all for coming and sharing your enthusiasts, that was great!
